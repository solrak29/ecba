# ECBA Console Feed

### *2018 (c)*

**Introduction**
```
Console is one of the destinations where you can send and receive chat messages.
This iteration will where it receives and can respond as "the bot" per se.

Thus there would be two states in the configuration where you can act as "the bot"
or as an initiator for chat.

The user will also have the flexability to use the console side either remotely or
or locally.  Locally, they would have to login into the instance that the application
is running.  Remotely, they would use the client interface (or web) to be on the
which ever side of the conversation that they want to be.
